They go back to the car and find a ladder

#speaker: Sera 
Hey, look. The ladder I bought a few months ago. This might come in handy.

#speaker: Aldrin
I never thought we’d actually have a reason to use that thing.

#speaker: Sera
See? You should be thanking me for being prepared.

#speaker: Aldrin
Yeah, yeah. My bad for being mad at you about buying it.

#speaker: Sera
Hehehe… Apology accepted
