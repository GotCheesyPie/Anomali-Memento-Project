The old sedan sits on the side of the empty forest road, hood popped open. Aldrin is crouched underneath, muttering curses at the engine. Sera lies flat on her back in the middle of the road, holding a crumpled piece of paper above her face.

#speaker: Sera
(squinting at the note) Hmmm ....

#speaker: Aldrin
(Trying to repair the car) What are you doing? You have been looking at the note for like 30 minutes already.

#speaker: Sera
And you have been tweaking the car for 30 minutes too.

#speaker: Sera
I’m bored and so what’s wrong trying to find clues in the note.

#speaker: Sera
Do you know how little information Lily gives us? It was intended to be an abandoned island where a slaughter took place in 1945 and that's it! That's literally all Lily gave us!!!

#speaker: Aldrin
(voice muffled from under the hood) Focus on something useful, Sera.

#speaker: Sera
(waving the paper) I am! I'm looking for hidden meanings. Secret codes. You know, actual intel.

#speaker: Sera
(holds it up to the light) Maybe there's invisible ink or something. No way that’s all Lily gave us. She’s not that cruel.

#speaker: Aldrin
It's a mission briefing, not a treasure map.

#speaker: Sera
Could be both. I mean, "take this carefully" - what does that even mean? Carefully how? Don't-touch-anything carefully? Don't-get-massacred-like-everyone-else carefully? How?

#speaker: Aldrin
(straightening up, wiping sweat from his forehead) It means don't do anything stupid.

#speaker: Sera
(grinning) Well, there goes half our usual strategy. (sits up) You know what would've been helpful? Maybe mentioning what kind of anomaly we're dealing with. Or why two Seekers just vanished. Or literally anything beyond "spooky island, people died, good luck!"

#speaker: Aldrin
We'll figure it out when we get there.

#speaker: Sera
If we get there. (stands up, brushing dirt off) Speaking of which, how's our trusty vintage transportation doing?

#speaker: Aldrin
(back under the hood) The radiator hose is completely shot, and I think the—

Suddenly, a loud CLANK echoes from the engine, followed by a hissing sound and a thick plume of black smoke.

#speaker: Aldrin
Shit! (stumbles backward)

#speaker: Sera
(walking away from the car) Whoa! That doesn't look good!

They both watch as more smoke blows out from under the hood.

#speaker: Aldrin
(staring at the smoking engine) That's... that's not supposed to happen.

#speaker: Sera
(coughing and waving smoke away) No kidding. I think your car just declared defeat.

#speaker: Aldrin
(running both hands through his hair) Great. Perfect. Just perfect!

#speaker: Sera
(patting his shoulder) Hey, look on the bright side. At least it waited until now to completely die. Could've happened in the middle of the city.

#speaker: Aldrin
(giving her a flat look) That's not helping.

#speaker: Sera 
(checking her phone) Okay, new plan. According to this, the bridge should be about two kilometers through the forest. We walk, check out this mysterious island, solve whatever weirdness is happening, and collect that very generous paycheck Lily mentioned.

#speaker: Aldrin
(looking back at his smoking car) I can't just leave it here.

#speaker: Sera
What choice do we have? It's not like we can push it. (grins) Besides, maybe some forest spirit will fix it while we're gone.

#speaker: Aldrin
Yeah, like hell that would happen...

#speaker: Sera
Come on, don’t be so down, Aldrin. Those missing Seekers aren't gonna find themselves, and I want to get paid before my phone dies completely.

#speaker: Aldrin
If we die out there because we had to walk into danger instead of driving away from it...

#speaker: Sera
(already heading toward the forest path) Then we'll die with really good cardio! Plus, think of it as an adventure!

#speaker: Aldrin
More like “Journey to the death”....

#speaker: Aldrin
Fine…Let’s get this over with
