Hey sera,  Can I ask you something?

#speaker: Sera
Yeah?

#speaker: Aldrin
Why'd you actually take this job? And don't say the money.

* [I’m bored] I’m bored. #speaker: Sera
    -> A
* [You need help] You need help. #speaker: Sera
    -> B
* [This sound cool] This sound cool. #speaker: Sera
    -> C


=== A ===
#speaker: Sera
Because I was bored out of my mind. I've been rewatching the same anime for the third time and eating nothing but indomie for two weeks.

#speaker: Aldrin
That's... depressingly on-brand for you.

#speaker: Sera
Hey, at least I'm self-aware about my life choices. Besides, creepy island mystery beats staring at my ceiling wondering if I have the money to buy another manga for my collection again.

#speaker: Aldrin
You just bought some last month.

#speaker: Sera
Exactly. Desperate times.

-> END

=== B ===
#speaker: Sera
Because you looked like you needed the distraction. You've been moping around for weeks, sighing dramatically every five minutes.

#speaker: Aldrin
I don't mope.

#speaker: Sera
Oh, you absolutely mope. It's like living with a sad ancient ghost. "Oh, the weight of existence without meaning..." (mimics his flat tone)

#speaker: Aldrin
(almost smiling) I don't sound like that.

#speaker: Sera
You totally do. But hey, nothing cures existential dread like a good old-fashioned job, right?

-> END

=== C ===
#speaker: Sera
Because abandoned islands sound cool. I mean, when's the last time we got to investigate somewhere actually interesting? 

#speaker: Sera
Our last three jobs were a haunted ATM, a possessed bus, and that weird thing with the singing toilet.

#speaker: Aldrin
The singing toilet was genuinely disturbing.

#speaker: Sera
Disturbing, yes, but not exactly exotic vacation material. This? It's like something out of a horror movie, but with better pay.

#speaker: Aldrin
You realize horror movies don't usually end well for the protagonists, right?

#speaker: Sera
Good thing we're not the protagonist type. We’ll survive no problem.
